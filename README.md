# Name Game: Gender Prediction using Sound
Analyze the gender distribution of children's book writers and use sound to match names to gender.

# Project Description
The same name can be spelled out in a many ways (for example, Marc and Mark, or Elizabeth and Elisabeth). Sound can, therefore, be a better way to match names than spelling. In this project, you will use the Python package Fuzzy to find out the genders of authors that have appeared in the New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture books.
